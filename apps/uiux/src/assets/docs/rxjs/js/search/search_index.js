Do not do this for the Icon's directory.\n cd ./dist/@uiux/cdk\n npm publish\n\n cd ./dist/@uiux/material\n npm publish\n\n cd ./projects/uiux/icons\n npm publish\n\n\nIxUtilities\nThis project was generated using Nx.\n\n\n&#x1F50E; Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.\nQuick Start & Documentation\nNx Documentation\n10-minute video showing all Nx features\nInteractive Tutorial\nAdding capabilities to your workspace\nNx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.\nThese capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.\nBelow are some plugins which you can add to your workspace:\n\nAngular\nng add @nrwl/angular\n\n\nReact\nng add @nrwl/react\n\n\nWeb (no framework frontends)\nng add @nrwl/web\n\n\nNest\nng add @nrwl/nest\n\n\nExpress\nng add @nrwl/express\n\n\nNode\nng add @nrwl/node\n\n\n\nGenerate an application\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app to generate an application.\n\nYou can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.\n\nWhen using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.\nGenerate a library\nRun ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib to generate a library.\n\nYou can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.\n\nLibraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from @ix-utilities/mylib.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve my-app for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng g component my-component --project=my-app to generate a new component.\nBuild\nRun ng build my-app to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test my-app to execute the unit tests via Jest.\nRun nx affected:test to execute the unit tests affected by a change.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e my-app to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.\nRun nx affected:e2e to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.\nUnderstand your workspace\nRun nx dep-graph to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.\nFurther help\nVisit the Nx Documentation to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n            \n                \n                    \n                        RxjsModule\n                    \n                    \n                                \n                                    No graph available.\n                                \n                        \n                            Browse\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n  \n\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\ndependencies\n\nLegend\n\n  Declarations\n\n  Module\n\n  Bootstrap\n\n  Providers\n\n  Exports\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Zoom in\n        Reset\n        Zoom out\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 Module\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    5 Classes\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
